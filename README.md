## Learning Outcomes

This project has given me the confidence and the skill to navigate the WordPress CMS, in addition to helping me solidify if not perfect my CSS/SASS skills due to the sheer amount of detail that was required for completion. Additionally, working on this project has helped me become very comfortable with using PHP, navigating the WordPress CMS, and understanding The WordPress Loop.

Last but not least, one of the most important outcomes happens to be one of the most crucial to understanding the functionality of WordPress, and that is the WordPress hierarchy. Completing this project has helped me understand the ins-and-outs of the hierarchy, and how to use it to develop a seamless WordPress website.
